# CCI_Advanced_Project

#### Explore AR interactive space

The theme of this project is carbon neutrality, and I was guided by my supervisor Phoenix Perry to do a lot of research on carbon neutrality, which eventually led me to do this exploratory AR project, trying to create a mysterious space that can only be accessed through the only door, where players can explore and learn about carbon neutrality and make changes in their own future lives.
